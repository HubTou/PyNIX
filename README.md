# PyNIX
PyNIX, as in **Py**thon U**NIX**, is an add-on to [The PNU Project](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU), bundling its [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) commands rewrites with other [Python](https://www.python.org/) software made by third parties.

## Objectives:
* Having some handy portable Unix tools, for example for Windows (though there are [plenty of other solutions](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/wiki/Wilderness-Survival-Guide) for that).

## Project status:
* You can install [what's available](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU/releases/latest) from [our package](https://pypi.org/project/PyNIX/) with the following console command:
```Shell
pip install PyNIX
```
